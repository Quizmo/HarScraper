# HarScraper
Scrapes and download the content from har files

To use download the har file from the browsers network tab, rename it to input.har and place it under bin\Release\net6.0\Input

Then run the HarScraper.exe under bin\Release\net6.0.

All content should be downloaded and placed in the folder called Output.

This has only been tested with Firefox, har files from Chrome might be different and might not work as expected.
